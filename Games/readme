This folder only contains game data. Deleting any folder will not harm the GameDev engine at all.
This section will be completely modular and can be safely copied and pasted to another system to add new games to it.

NOTE:
config.json lists all the games that are currently being tracked by the tool. Refreshing the game list within the tool's home page will update this file.
