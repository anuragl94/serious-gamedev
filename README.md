# Tool to create serious games and facilitate gamification of education
Project under Guide Dr. Viraj Kumar
Carried out at PESIT, Bangalore. India.

Note: This version is a hotfix that ignores modularity and contains all the game code in a single file.
The development branch will not follow this pattern. Everything will be strictly modular on that branch.

Generic structure of a module:
Either renders some HTML, or updates the global variable gameData, or creates some event listeners

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Run "Non modular game/Gamescreen1.html", but with disable-web-security flag enabled on chrome.
